Accessing the Tableau story above, we see the following pages/visualizations and descriptions:

* Demographics:
    * Number of Trips
        * Contains basic information for how many trips were recorded in the month of August, 2019.
    * Customer Type
        * Details that the majority of users are subscribers to Citi Bike. 
    * August Peak Hours
        * Here, we see that the busiest hour is 5:00 p.m. followed by 6:00 p.m.
    * Gender Breakdown
        * In this visualization, we see that the majority of users for Citi Bike are identified as male.
* Checkout Times
    * This visualization shows us that the majority of users for Citi Bike checkout a bike less than 1 hour. The most popular checkout time for a bike is 5 minutes in length.
* Checkout Times by Gender
    * As we already demonstrated, we see that the majority of users identify as male for Citi Bike. In this visualization we see that the overall trend of renting a bike for about 5 minutes in length is largely consistent among the demographic populations represented. 
* Trip Heatmaps:
    * Trips by Weekday per Hour
        * This visualization tells us two things:
            1) Monday, Tuesday and Thursday tend to be busier days during the week in the afternoon.
            2) Saturdays and Sundays tend to be consistent. 
    * Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
        * This visualization breaks down the trips by gender and shows us that males tend to be more concentrated during certain times of the week.
* User trips by Gender by Weekday
    * In this visualization, we breakdown our dataset even further by the type of user and the gender of the user. From here, we see that male subscribers tend to make up the majority of users.

## Summary:

In a review of the visualizations here, it certainly seems as though there is a large enough market for a Citi Bike program in Des Moines. As demonstrated, throughout the weekday, there is a lot of utilization of the bikes and the majority of users are subscribers to Citi Bike itself. All of this bodes well for investment opportunities however, two other visualizations would provide a clearer view of the viability of such a program.

1) Comparative density of businesses/locations between Des Moines and New York City.

Considering the amount of time users are renting bikes for, it can be assumed they are not taking them far distances. With that in mind, comparing the density between the locations would be valuable.

2) Operating Costs vs Revenue

This would be another visualization that would demonstrate the profitability of the program itself and would certainly be useful to anyone considering investing.
